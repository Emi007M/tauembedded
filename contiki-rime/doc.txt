 Contiki Rime - Lab Report
----------------------------

3. We implemented two new processes that await a post signal to turn off the leds (each one is responsible for a different led).
 On the receive callback we turn the red led ON then call process_post() with the event to the red led process.
 On the timer event in the main process we turn the green led ON then call process_post() with the event to the green led process.

4. We tested the range of reception:
 we walked with one node outside of the lab and we tested that it receives the communication across the wall boundry.
 we walked a bit outside the class to try and see when it does not receive any more.

6.7. We were not able to get bigger hop number than 4, we walked inside the building trying to communicate to the sink.

8. We changed a differenet channel (virtual) and tested that we can't communicate with others using different channel.

9. We found accoridng to the CC2420 product spec that it enumerates the channels as 11-26 so we used the lower bound channel 11,
	and we tested that we can't communicate with others using a different physical channel.
