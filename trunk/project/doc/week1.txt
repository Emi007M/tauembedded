 Advanced Network Storage Device - Progress report : week1 3/1/10
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The code is in svn: http://tauembedded.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/project/src/trunk/

 Tasks Accomplished
--------------------

 1. Working spi driver compatible for mmc commands, not compatible for the ethernet commands.
 2. Partial mmc protocol implementation ported to the board and tested (block access).
 3. Integrated printf to send text to uart for easy debugging.
 4. Ethernet driver for the extension enc28j60, untested. 
 5. uIP TCP/IP stack porting.
 6. Makefile build system for the application.

 Current Issues
------------------
 1. Both ethernet and mmc use spi1. So we need to test if they work together,
    In addition maybe use spi0 for one of them.

 2. The spi driver has a problem communicating with the enc28j60.

 Plan for next week
--------------------

 1. Integrate FatFS with the MMC driver.
 2. Integrate uIP with the Eth. driver and run the hello-world app.
