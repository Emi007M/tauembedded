 Basics - Report
-----------------

2. We used interrupts to solve the problem. 
We initialized a state variable which differentiated between two states:
a) Waiting on the P0.14 event
b) Waiting for the timer event
In each state we disabled the other interrupt and 
enabled the interrupt for the event.
EXTINT was reset every time because when disabling using 
VICIntEnClr the interrupt flag is still raised.

The 50ms time was not enough for the debouncing. 
Testing with 100ms showed better results.

3. We tested using longer time intervals which 
were easier to for us to control and react to.

4. The emulation of the bicycle blinker is achieved using three states:
a) initial off state - clears P0.14 press INT and switches the led on, transfers control to state (b)
b) on state - clears P0.14 press INT, starts timer0 and transfers control to state (c)
c) blink state - 
     if the INT is P0.14 press - clears P0.14 press INT, stops timer0, 
     							switches led off and transfers control to state (a) 
     							
     if the INT is timer0 - toggle the led and clear timer0 INT
