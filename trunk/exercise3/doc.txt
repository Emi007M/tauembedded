 Exercise 3 - Report
-----------------

We did not have enough time to complete the exercise.
This is partly due to the fact that we thought that questions 4 and 5
should be imlepmented using the boards PWM capabilities, which we 
spent a lot of time understanding. After failing to make it work
we asked Dror who told us we should implement it by hand.

If possible We would very much like to complete this exercise at the next lab.

1. We implemented a fiq isr which runs systic_periodic_task(). 
The fiq is run every milisecond using the built in counter.

2. We used a systic_periodic_task which is very similar to the presented example, 
except that the constant was replaced so that the toggle period would be 1024 ms.

3. busywaitInit() was implemented by performing 100000 simple processor operations 
and running the counter in parallel. Then the ration of instuctions per microsecond was calculated and placed in g_calib.
busywait() multiplies the number of microseconds we want to wait by g_calib and runs a simple loop for this amount of iters.

7. No, the bulb will not stop emmiting light because it will not have 
enough time to cool down between the periods it is on.
