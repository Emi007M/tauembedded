 Exercise usb - Report
-----------------------

5. The device is an echo server. It prints everything it is given on the uart line.
6. We tried several baud rates and found that 14400 and 28800 are not supported,
but 2400 and 115200 are supported. 
7. We changed the function that returns the device descriptor and saw the errors in dmesg.
8. We implemeted the following protocol:
      start - starts receiving commands
      bl-on - turns backlight on
      bl-off - turns backlight off
      clear - clears the screen
      other msg - prints msg string
10. (a) We changed the mouse report data so that mouse button bit1 is turned on when P0.14 is clicked. 
The result was that the right mouse button was activated when P0.14 was clicked.
