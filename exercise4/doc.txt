 Exercise 4 - Report
---------------------

1. We are using the uart, the test has passed.

2. We implemented the i2cInit() function by setting the I2CEN bit, and setting the I20SCLL/I20CLH registers
 according to the formula in the documentation, we could not set 400Khz bit rate so we aimed at 375Khz.
 The rest of the driver we implemented according to the MCU documentation, we used polling on the SI bit and enabled
 the IRQ that handles the interrupt, we check the status after each SI clearing and implemented the read/write features.

3. We tried to test the driver for reading 2 bytes from the peripheral however we have bugs and we receive the SLA+R!W back on the bus.
It is possible that we need to clear the START bit.

4. We implemented the temperature conversion function using the LM75 document and tested it apart from the driver code.

5. Up to 8 LM75's can serve on one I2C bus. This is because LM75 has 3 address selection bits.

6. TBD.
